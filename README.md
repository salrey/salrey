Pursuing a career in software development fulfills some of my greatest passions, including innovating technologies, economic empowerment, research, and general problem-solving.

# ðŸŒ±

In many aspects of my life, I have dealt with what seems like the impossible and persevered, preparing me for my new journey of becoming a software engineer. As an entrepreneur and a Full Stack Software Engineer, I enjoy a diverse range of interests and fundamentally love to build companies, communities, and transformative experiences.

I am constantly generating insights from understanding how technological trends change the behavior of people and markets and I look forward to engaging with other luminaries, professionals, or peers in my field, who want to create innovative applications.

In my next role, I hope to explore disruptive consumer-centric technology products and deliver solutions that are flexible, brilliant and impactful.
